fapt -- the Fake APT
====================

Install packages using the Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) without root access

 - no sudo needed to install fapt
 - no sudo needed to run fapt (ie to install other software)
 - usable in conjunction with globally-installed packages (similar to virtualenv WITH site packages)
 - no special activation needed
 - debootstrap not needed (no need to download redundant dependencies)

This should be useful whenever you don't have root access:

 - shared hosting
 - shared school computer system
 - PaaS providers ([dotCloud](http://dotcloud.com) etc.)

Requirements:

 - shell access
 - system uses apt for its own package management
 - fakeroot
 - gcc
 - a sane local bash environment (use my bash env bootstrap script)


fapt uses prebuilt binary packages, it does NOT build packages upon downloading

Rationale
---------

The whole point of unix is to be multi-user, but a system isn't very useful if I don't have the software I need. "Sure," says the sysadmin, "you can install whatever you want.
Just go find the tarball, download unpack, compile and install it locally."

Works great. Until you need to install ffmpeg; 30 dependencies later (excluding any special codecs) you appreciate why they call it dependency hell.

Isn't that what package management was made for? I thought so too.


Installation
------------

Make sure your local bash environment is well configured. fapt assumes the environment is like what comes out of my [bootstrap_local_bash_env.sh script](https://github.com/gabrielgrant/bootstrap/raw/master/bootstrap_local_bash_env.sh)


Step one (and only):

    curl https://github.com/gabrielgrant/fapt/raw/master/quickstart.sh | source /dev/stdin


Usage
-----

fapt only does installation at the moment, so the command works like apt-get install:

    fapt <package name> [<other package name> [...]]
